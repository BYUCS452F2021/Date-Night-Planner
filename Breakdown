Basically, my wife and I got tired of asking the same questions:
1. What do you want to eat tonight?
2. What do you want to watch tonight?
3. What should we do for date night?

So we came up with an app idea to answer these questions for you! Basically, this app is going to have a user who can log in and has a preset number of options, specifically around Provo to start!
The goal of the app is to simplify creating a "Date Night" or showing you all of the options you have in one place! The idea is that with the preset list of restaurants, movies, and other date ideas around Provo, with your significant other you could quickly come up with something to do!
In the future you could work with local businesses to offer deals to couples who use the app and decide to go to their business and so on!

I think a team of anywhere from 3-5 would be good!

I think a Column-Oriented Database would work best

Business - Working with local businesses to give them advertising and we could pull a percentage of their profit off of the people who use our app to use their service.
Operations - Updating the app to reflect new business or finding a way to dynamically fill the local dates.
Legal - Contracts for Businesses
Technical - Technical will have to do with a Web App Support, maybe a iPhone and Android App Support, starting with a web app would be easiest I think!
Social - This would be good for people going on group dates as well, there is no limit as to your group size when deciding what to do!
